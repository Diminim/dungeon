Tabs over spaces, size = 4.
Single quotes over double quotes.
snake_case.
function () declarations should have a space after the name but before the arguments.
use the name = function () style of declarations

if multiple tables have the same format, create a constructor
if it makes sense to create a local scope variable, create a function that accepts
    that variable as an argument.
if you do the same operation on a set of data, use an iterator.
Easy to read, easy to edit is the motto.

git commits you don't have a description for get a single .

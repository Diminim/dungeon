Let's pretend the rpg battle system is managed by a state machine
I can tell the battle system the situation after every action

Let's put that to the side.

What if a character dies and a system in the game wants to know about that
I want to print "X has died" when character X's hp drops to or below 0.

So *something* has to evaluate for that, and then send out message when it occurs

evaluation has to happen after every action
That thing has to know pretty much everything

Put that to the side

An event is something I have to define
Something has to evaluate for that event
Something has to register that event's occurence
Something has to do something with that register

Events should be tied to things that happen once
